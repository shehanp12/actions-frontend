immediately returns. The initial status of the\n   *          delivery stream is <code>CREATING</code>. After the delivery stream is created, its status\n   *          is <code>ACTIVE</code> and it now accepts data. If the delivery stream creation fails, the\n   *          status transitions to <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>. Attempts to send data to a delivery\n   *          stream that is not in the <code>ACTIVE</code> state cause an exception. To check the state\n   *          of a delivery stream, use <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>.</p>\n   *          <p>If the status of a delivery stream is <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>, this status\n   *          doesn't change, and you can't invoke <code>CreateDeliveryStream</code> again on it.\n   *          However, you can invoke the <a>DeleteDeliveryStream</a> operation to delete\n   *          it.</p>\n   *          <p>A Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream can be configured to receive records directly\n   *          from providers using <a>PutRecord</a> or <a>PutRecordBatch</a>, or it\n   *          can be configured to use an existing Kinesis stream as its source. To specify a Kinesis\n   *          data stream as input, set the <code>DeliveryStreamType</code> parameter to\n   *             <code>KinesisStreamAsSource</code>, and provide the Kinesis stream Amazon Resource Name\n   *          (ARN) and role ARN in the <code>KinesisStreamSourceConfiguration</code>\n   *          parameter.</p>\n   *          <p>To create a delivery stream with server-side encryption (SSE) enabled, include <a>DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfigurationInput</a> in your request. This is\n   *          optional. You can also invoke <a>StartDeliveryStreamEncryption</a> to turn on\n   *          SSE for an existing delivery stream that doesn't have SSE enabled.</p>\n   *          <p>A delivery stream is configured with a single destination: Amazon S3, Amazon ES,\n   *          Amazon Redshift, or Splunk. You must specify only one of the following destination\n   *          configuration parameters: <code>ExtendedS3DestinationConfiguration</code>,\n   *             <code>S3DestinationConfiguration</code>,\n   *             <code>ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration</code>,\n   *             <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration</code>, or\n   *             <code>SplunkDestinationConfiguration</code>.</p>\n   *          <p>When you specify <code>S3DestinationConfiguration</code>, you can also provide the\n   *          following optional values: BufferingHints, <code>EncryptionConfiguration</code>, and\n   *             <code>CompressionFormat</code>. By default, if no <code>BufferingHints</code> value is\n   *          provided, Kinesis Data Firehose buffers data up to 5 MB or for 5 minutes, whichever\n   *          condition is satisfied first. <code>BufferingHints</code> is a hint, so there are some\n   *          cases where the service cannot adhere to these conditions strictly. For example, record\n   *          boundaries might be such that the size is a little over or under the configured buffering\n   *          size. By default, no encryption is performed. We strongly recommend that you enable\n   *          encryption to ensure secure data storage in Amazon S3.</p>\n   *\n   *          <p>A few notes about Amazon Redshift as a destination:</p>\n   *          <ul>\n   *             <li>\n   *                <p>An Amazon Redshift destination requires an S3 bucket as intermediate location.\n   *                Kinesis Data Firehose first delivers data to Amazon S3 and then uses\n   *                   <code>COPY</code> syntax to load data into an Amazon Redshift table.
