Only the\n *          resource owner (that is, the AWS account that created it) can access the resource. The\n *          resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access\n *          policy. For this operation, a user must get the s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration\n *          permission.</p>\n *\n *          <p>You can also explicitly deny permissions. Explicit deny also supersedes any other\n *          permissions. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from\n *          your bucket, you must deny them permissions for the following actions:</p>\n *\n *          <ul>\n *

Only the\n *          resource owner (that is, the AWS account that created it) can access the resource. The\n *          resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access\n *          policy. For this operation, a user must get the s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration\n *          permission.</p>\n *\n *          <p>You can also explicitly deny permissions. Explicit deny also supersedes any other\n *          permissions. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from\n *          your bucket, you must deny them permissions for the following actions:</p>\n *\n *          <ul>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>s3:DeleteObject</p>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>s3:DeleteObjectVersion</p>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration</p>\n *             </li>\n *          </ul>\n *\n *\n *          <p>For more information about permissions, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html\">Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3\n *             Resources</a>.</p>\n *\n *          <p>The following are related to <code>PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</code>:</p>\n *          <ul>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>\n *                   <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/lifecycle-configuration-examples.html\">Examples of\n *                   Lifecycle Configuration</a>\n *                </p>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>\n *                   <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html\">GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a>\n *                </p>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>\n *                   <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketLifecycle.html\">DeleteBucketLifecycle</a>\n *                </p>\n *             </li>\n *          </ul>\n */\nexport class PutBucketLifecycleConfigurationCommand extends $Command<\n  PutBucketLifecycleConfigurationCommandInput,\n  PutBucketLifecycleConfigurationCommandOutput,\n  S3ClientResolvedConfig\n> {\n  // Start section: command_properties\n  // End section: command_properties\n\n  constructor(readonly input: PutBucketLifecycleConfigurationCommandInput) {\n    // Start section: command_constructor\n    super();\n    // End section: command_constructor\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @internal\n   */\n  resolveMiddleware(\n    clientStack: MiddlewareStack<ServiceInputTypes, ServiceOutputTypes>,\n    configuration: S3ClientResolvedConfig,\n    options?: __HttpHandlerOptions\n  ): Handler<PutBucketLifecycleConfigurationCommandInput, PutBucketLifecycleConfigurationCommandOutput> {\n    this.middlewareStack.use(getSerdePlugin(configuration, this.serialize, this.deserialize));\n    this.middlewareStack.use(getBucketEndpointPlugin(configuration));\n    this.middlewareStack.use(getApplyMd5BodyChecksumPlugin(configuration));\n\n    const stack = clientStack.concat(this.middlewareStack);\n\n    const { logger } = configuration;\n    const clientName = \"S3Client\";\n    const commandName = \"PutBucketLifecycleConfigurationCommand\";\n    const handlerExecutionContext: HandlerExecutionContext = {\n      logger,\n      clientName,\n      commandName,\n      inputFilterSensitiveLog: PutBucketLifecycleConfigurationRequest.filterSensitiveLog,\n      outputFilterSensitiveLog: (output: any) => output,\n    };\n    const { requestHandler } = configuration;\n    return stack.resolve(\n      (request: FinalizeHandlerArguments<any>) =>\n        requestHandler.handle(request.request as __HttpRequest, options || {}),\n      handlerExecutionContext\n    );\n  }\n\n  private serialize(\n    input: PutBucketLifecycleConfigurationCommandInput,\n    context: __SerdeContext\n  ): Promise<__HttpRequest> {\n    return serializeAws_restXmlPutBucketLifecycleConfigurationCommand(input, context);\n  }\n\n  private deserialize(\n    output: __HttpResponse,\n    context: __SerdeContext\n  ): Promise<PutBucketLifecycleConfigurationCommandOutput> {\n    return deserializeAws_restXmlPutBucketLifecycleConfigurationCommand(output, context);\n  }\n\n  // Start section: command_body_extra\n  // End section: command_body_extra\n}\n"},"lineCount":null}},"error":null,"hash":"af4b05498ba457b915b73c12676f8e83","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
