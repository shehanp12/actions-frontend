For\n *          more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html\">Storage\n *             Classes</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>\n *          <p>\n *             <b>Versioning</b>\n *          </p>\n *          <p>By default, <code>x-amz-copy-source</code> identifies the current version of an object\n *          to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was\n *          deleted. To copy a different version, use the <code>versionId</code> subresource.</p>\n *          <p>If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for\n *          the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source\n *          object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the\n *             <code>x-amz-version-id</code> response header in the response.</p>\n *          <p>If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that\n *          Amazon S3 generates is always null.</p>\n *          <p>If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object\n *          before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation.
