To write single\n *          data records into a delivery stream, use <a>PutRecord</a>. Applications using\n *          these operations are referred to as producers.</p>\n *          <p>For information about service quota, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/limits.html\">Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose\n *          Quota</a>.</p>\n *          <p>Each <a>PutRecordBatch</a> request supports up to 500 records. Each record\n *          in the request can be as large as 1,000 KB (before 64-bit encoding), up to a limit of 4 MB\n *          for the entire request. These limits cannot be changed.</p>\n *          <p>You must specify the name of the delivery stream and the data record when using <a>PutRecord</a>. The data record consists of a data blob that can be up to 1,000\n *          KB in size, and any kind of data. For example, it could be a segment from a log file,\n *          geographic location data, website clickstream data, and so on.</p>\n *          <p>Kinesis Data Firehose buffers records before delivering them to the destination. To\n *          disambiguate the data blobs at the destination, a common solution is to use delimiters in\n *          the data, such as a newline (<code>\\n</code>) or some other character unique within the\n *          data. This allows the consumer application to parse individual data items when reading the\n *          data from the destination.</p>\n *          <p>The <a>PutRecordBatch</a> response includes a count of failed records,\n *             <code>FailedPutCount</code>, and an array of responses, <code>RequestResponses</code>.\n *          Even if the <a>PutRecordBatch</a> call succeeds, the value of\n *             <code>FailedPutCount</code> may be greater than 0, indicating that there are records for\n *          which the operation didn't succeed. Each entry in the <code>RequestResponses</code> array\n *          provides additional information about the processed record. It directly correlates with a\n *          record in the request array using the same ordering, from the top to the bottom. The\n *          response array always includes the same number of records as the request array.\n *             <code>RequestResponses</code> includes both successfully and unsuccessfully processed\n *          records. Kinesis Data Firehose tries to process all records in each <a>PutRecordBatch</a> request. A single record failure does not stop the processing\n *          of subsequent records. </p>\n *          <p>A successfully processed record includes a <code>RecordId</code> value, which is\n *          unique for the record. An unsuccessfully processed record includes <code>ErrorCode</code>\n *          and <code>ErrorMessage</code> values. <code>ErrorCode</code> reflects the type of error,\n *          and is one of the following values: <code>ServiceUnavailableException</code> or\n *             <code>InternalFailure</code>. <code>ErrorMessage</code> provides more detailed\n *          information about the error.</p>\n *          <p>If there is an internal server error or a timeout, the write might have completed or\n *          it might have failed. If <code>FailedPutCount</code> is greater than 0, retry the request,\n *          resending only those records that might have failed processing. This minimizes the possible\n *          duplicate records and also reduces the total bytes sent (and corresponding charges). We\n *          recommend that you handle any duplicates at the destination.</p>\n *          <p>If <a>PutRecordBatch</a> throws <code>ServiceUnavailableException</code>,\n *          back off and retry. If the exception persists, it is possible that the throughput limits\n *          have been exceeded for the delivery stream.</p>\n *\n *          <p>Data records sent to Kinesis Data Firehose are stored for 24 hours from the time they\n *          are added to a delivery stream as it attempts to send the records to the destination. If\n *          the destination is unreachable for more than 24 hours, the data is no longer\n *          available.</p>\n *          <important>\n *             <p>Don't concatenate two or more

To write single\n *          data records into a delivery stream, use <a>PutRecord</a>. Applications using\n *          these operations are referred to as producers.</p>\n *          <p>For information about service quota, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/limits.html\">Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose\n *          Quota</a>.</p>\n *          <p>Each <a>PutRecordBatch</a> request supports up to 500 records. Each record\n *          in the request can be as large as 1,000 KB (before 64-bit encoding), up to a limit of 4 MB\n *          for the entire request. These limits cannot be changed.</p>\n *          <p>You must specify the name of the delivery stream and the data record when using <a>PutRecord</a>. The data record consists of a data blob that can be up to 1,000\n *          KB in size, and any kind of data. For example, it could be a segment from a log file,\n *          geographic location data, website clickstream data, and so on.</p>\n *          <p>Kinesis Data Firehose buffers records before delivering them to the destination. To\n *          disambiguate the data blobs at the destination, a common solution is to use delimiters in\n *          the data, such as a newline (<code>\\n</code>) or some other character unique within the\n *          data. This allows the consumer application to parse individual data items when reading the\n *          data from the destination.</p>\n *          <p>The <a>PutRecordBatch</a> response includes a count of failed records,\n *             <code>FailedPutCount</code>, and an array of responses, <code>RequestResponses</code>.\n *          Even if the <a>PutRecordBatch</a> call succeeds, the value of\n *             <code>FailedPutCount</code> may be greater than 0, indicating that there are records for\n *          which the operation didn't succeed. Each entry in the <code>RequestResponses</code> array\n *          provides additional information about the processed record. It directly correlates with a\n *          record in the request array using the same ordering, from the top to the bottom. The\n *          response array always includes the same number of records as the request array.\n *             <code>RequestResponses</code> includes both successfully and unsuccessfully processed\n *          records. Kinesis Data Firehose tries to process all records in each <a>PutRecordBatch</a> request. A single record failure does not stop the processing\n *          of subsequent records. </p>\n *          <p>A successfully processed record includes a <code>RecordId</code> value, which is\n *          unique for the record. An unsuccessfully processed record includes <code>ErrorCode</code>\n *          and <code>ErrorMessage</code> values. <code>ErrorCode</code> reflects the type of error,\n *          and is one of the following values: <code>ServiceUnavailableException</code> or\n *             <code>InternalFailure</code>. <code>ErrorMessage</code> provides more detailed\n *          information about the error.</p>\n *          <p>If there is an internal server error or a timeout, the write might have completed or\n *          it might have failed. If <code>FailedPutCount</code> is greater than 0, retry the request,\n *          resending only those records that might have failed processing. This minimizes the possible\n *          duplicate records and also reduces the total bytes sent (and corresponding charges). We\n *          recommend that you handle any duplicates at the destination.</p>\n *          <p>If <a>PutRecordBatch</a> throws <code>ServiceUnavailableException</code>,\n *          back off and retry. If the exception persists, it is possible that the throughput limits\n *          have been exceeded for the delivery stream.</p>\n *\n *          <p>Data records sent to Kinesis Data Firehose are stored for 24 hours from the time they\n *          are added to a delivery stream as it attempts to send the records to the destination. If\n *          the destination is unreachable for more than 24 hours, the data is no longer\n *          available.</p>\n *          <important>\n *             <p>Don't concatenate two or more base64 strings to form the data fields of your records.\n *             Instead, concatenate the raw data, then perform base64 encoding.</p>\n *          </important>\n */\nexport class PutRecordBatchCommand extends $Command<\n  PutRecordBatchCommandInput,\n  PutRecordBatchCommandOutput,\n  FirehoseClientResolvedConfig\n> {\n  // Start section: command_properties\n  // End section: command_properties\n\n  constructor(readonly input: PutRecordBatchCommandInput) {\n    // Start section: command_constructor\n    super();\n    // End section: command_constructor\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @internal\n   */\n  resolveMiddleware(\n    clientStack: MiddlewareStack<ServiceInputTypes, ServiceOutputTypes>,\n    configuration: FirehoseClientResolvedConfig,\n    options?: __HttpHandlerOptions\n  ): Handler<PutRecordBatchCommandInput, PutRecordBatchCommandOutput> {\n    this.middlewareStack.use(getSerdePlugin(configuration, this.serialize, this.deserialize));\n\n    const stack = clientStack.concat(this.middlewareStack);\n\n    const { logger } = configuration;\n    const clientName = \"FirehoseClient\";\n    const commandName = \"PutRecordBatchCommand\";\n    const handlerExecutionContext: HandlerExecutionContext = {\n      logger,\n      clientName,\n      commandName,\n      inputFilterSensitiveLog: PutRecordBatchInput.filterSensitiveLog,\n      outputFilterSensitiveLog: PutRecordBatchOutput.filterSensitiveLog,\n    };\n    const { requestHandler } = configuration;\n    return stack.resolve(\n      (request: FinalizeHandlerArguments<any>) =>\n        requestHandler.handle(request.request as __HttpRequest, options || {}),\n      handlerExecutionContext\n    );\n  }\n\n  private serialize(input: PutRecordBatchCommandInput, context: __SerdeContext): Promise<__HttpRequest> {\n    return serializeAws_json1_1PutRecordBatchCommand(input, context);\n  }\n\n  private deserialize(output: __HttpResponse, context: __SerdeContext): Promise<PutRecordBatchCommandOutput> {\n    return deserializeAws_json1_1PutRecordBatchCommand(output, context);\n  }\n\n  // Start section: command_body_extra\n  // End section: command_body_extra\n}\n"},"lineCount":null}},"error":null,"hash":"80bc00bc4c2533d4bae10a278b9caa7f","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
