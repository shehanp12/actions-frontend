For example, if you have two shards, one with a hash key\n *             range of 276...381 and the other with a hash key range of 382...454, then you could\n *             merge these two shards into a single shard that would have a hash key range of\n *             276...454.

shards in a Kinesis data stream and combines them into a single\n *             shard to reduce the stream's capacity to ingest and transport data. Two shards are\n *             considered adjacent if the union of the hash key ranges for the two shards form a\n *             contiguous set with no gaps. For example, if you have two shards, one with a hash key\n *             range of 276...381 and the other with a hash key range of 382...454, then you could\n *             merge these two shards into a single shard that would have a hash key range of\n *             276...454. After the merge, the single child shard receives data for all hash key values\n *             covered by the two parent shards.</p>\n *         <p>\n *             <code>MergeShards</code> is called when there is a need to reduce the overall capacity\n *             of a stream because of excess capacity that is not being used. You must specify the\n *             shard to be merged and the adjacent shard for a stream. For more information about\n *             merging shards, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-resharding-merge.html\">Merge Two\n *                 Shards</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer\n *                 Guide</i>.</p>\n *         <p>If the stream is in the <code>ACTIVE</code> state, you can call\n *                 <code>MergeShards</code>. If a stream is in the <code>CREATING</code>,\n *                 <code>UPDATING</code>, or <code>DELETING</code> state, <code>MergeShards</code>\n *             returns a <code>ResourceInUseException</code>. If the specified stream does not exist,\n *                 <code>MergeShards</code> returns a <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code>. </p>\n *         <p>You can use <a>DescribeStream</a> to check the state of the stream,\n *             which is returned in <code>StreamStatus</code>.</p>\n *         <p>\n *             <code>MergeShards</code> is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a\n *                 <code>MergeShards</code> request, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns a\n *             response and sets the <code>StreamStatus</code> to <code>UPDATING</code>. After the\n *             operation is completed, Kinesis Data Streams sets the <code>StreamStatus</code> to\n *                 <code>ACTIVE</code>. Read and write operations continue to work while the stream is\n *             in the <code>UPDATING</code> state. </p>\n *         <p>You use <a>DescribeStream</a> to determine the shard IDs that are\n *             specified in the <code>MergeShards</code> request. </p>\n *         <p>If you try to operate on too many streams in parallel using <a>CreateStream</a>, <a>DeleteStream</a>, <code>MergeShards</code>,\n *             or <a>SplitShard</a>, you receive a <code>LimitExceededException</code>. </p>\n *         <p>\n *             <code>MergeShards</code> has a limit of five transactions per second per\n *             account.</p>\n */\nexport class MergeShardsCommand extends $Command<\n  MergeShardsCommandInput,\n  MergeShardsCommandOutput,\n  KinesisClientResolvedConfig\n> {\n  // Start section: command_properties\n  // End section: command_properties\n\n  constructor(readonly input: MergeShardsCommandInput) {\n    // Start section: command_constructor\n    super();\n    // End section: command_constructor\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @internal\n   */\n  resolveMiddleware(\n    clientStack: MiddlewareStack<ServiceInputTypes, ServiceOutputTypes>,\n    configuration: KinesisClientResolvedConfig,\n    options?: __HttpHandlerOptions\n  ): Handler<MergeShardsCommandInput, MergeShardsCommandOutput> {\n    this.middlewareStack.use(getSerdePlugin(configuration, this.serialize, this.deserialize));\n\n    const stack = clientStack.concat(this.middlewareStack);\n\n    const { logger } = configuration;\n    const clientName = \"KinesisClient\";\n    const commandName = \"MergeShardsCommand\";\n    const handlerExecutionContext: HandlerExecutionContext = {\n      logger,\n      clientName,\n      commandName,\n      inputFilterSensitiveLog: MergeShardsInput.filterSensitiveLog,\n      outputFilterSensitiveLog: (output: any) => output,\n    };\n    const { requestHandler } = configuration;\n    return stack.resolve(\n      (request: FinalizeHandlerArguments<any>) =>\n        requestHandler.handle(request.request as __HttpRequest, options || {}),\n      handlerExecutionContext\n    );\n  }\n\n  private serialize(input: MergeShardsCommandInput, context: __SerdeContext): Promise<__HttpRequest> {\n    return serializeAws_json1_1MergeShardsCommand(input, context);\n  }\n\n  private deserialize(output: __HttpResponse, context: __SerdeContext): Promise<MergeShardsCommandOutput> {\n    return deserializeAws_json1_1MergeShardsCommand(output, context);\n  }\n\n  // Start section: command_body_extra\n  // End section: command_body_extra\n}\n"},"lineCount":null}},"error":null,"hash":"3ccf64ea32d8e4f89730aaec59713103","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
