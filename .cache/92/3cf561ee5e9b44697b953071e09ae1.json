To set the logging status of a bucket, you must be the bucket owner.</p>\n *\n *          <p>The bucket owner is automatically granted FULL_CONTROL to all logs. You use the\n *             <code>Grantee</code> request element to grant access to other people. The\n *             <code>Permissions</code> request element specifies the kind of access the grantee has to\n *          the logs.</p>\n *\n *          <p>\n *             <b>Grantee Values</b>\n *          </p>\n *          <p>You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using\n *          request elements) in the following ways:</p>\n *\n *          <ul>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>By the person's ID:</p>\n *                <p>\n *                   <code><Grantee xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n *                   xsi:type=\"CanonicalUser\"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName>\n *                   </Grantee></code>\n *                </p>\n *                <p>DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.</p>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>By Email address:</p>\n *                <p>\n *                   <code> <Grantee xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n *                   xsi:type=\"AmazonCustomerByEmail\"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress></Grantee></code>\n *                </p>\n *                <p>The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object\n *                acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.</p>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>By URI:</p>\n *                <p>\n *                   <code><Grantee xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n *                   xsi:type=\"Group\"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee></code>\n *                </p>\n *             </li>\n *          </ul>\n *\n *\n *          <p>To enable logging, you use LoggingEnabled and its children request elements.
