When you call the <a>ListFaces</a> operation, the response returns the external ID. You can use this\n *       external image ID to create a client-side index to associate the faces with each image. You\n *       can then use the index to find all faces in an image.</p>\n *          <p>You can specify the maximum number of faces to index with the <code>MaxFaces</code> input\n *       parameter. This is useful when you want to index the largest faces in an image and don't want to index\n *       smaller faces, such as those belonging to people standing in the background.</p>\n *          <p>The <code>QualityFilter</code> input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces\n *       that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a\n *       variety of common use cases. By default, <code>IndexFaces</code> chooses the quality bar that's\n *       used to filter faces.  You can also explicitly choose\n *       the quality bar. Use <code>QualityFilter</code>, to set the quality bar\n *       by specifying <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, or <code>HIGH</code>.\n *       If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify <code>NONE</code>. </p>\n *          <note>\n *             <p>To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the\n *     face model or higher. To get the version of the face model associated with a collection, call\n *       <a>DescribeCollection</a>. </p>\n *          </note>\n *          <p>Information about faces detected in an image, but not indexed, is returned in an array of\n *       <a>UnindexedFace</a> objects, <code>UnindexedFaces</code>. Faces aren't\n *       indexed for reasons such as:</p>\n *          <ul>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>The number of faces detected exceeds the value of the <code>MaxFaces</code> request\n *           parameter.</p>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>The face is too small compared to the image dimensions.</p>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>The face is too blurry.</p>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>The image is too dark.</p>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>The face has an extreme pose.</p>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>The face doesn’t have enough detail to be suitable for face search.</p>\n *             </li>\n *          </ul>\n *          <p>In response, the <code>IndexFaces</code> operation returns an array of metadata for\n *       all detected faces, <code>FaceRecords</code>.

If you provide\n *       the same image, specify the same collection, and use the same external ID in the\n *         <code>IndexFaces</code> operation, Amazon Rekognition doesn't save duplicate face metadata.</p>\n *\n *\n *          <p></p>\n *\n *\n *          <p>The input image is passed either as base64-encoded image bytes, or as a reference to an\n *       image in an Amazon S3 bucket.
