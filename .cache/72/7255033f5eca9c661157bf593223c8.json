Virginia) Region. You can\n *          optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to optimize\n *          latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in\n *          Europe, you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland)\n *          Region. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro\">Accessing a\n *          bucket</a>.</p>\n *          <note>\n *             <p>If you send your create bucket request to the <code>s3.amazonaws.com</code> endpoint,\n *             the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly, the signature calculations in\n *             Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in\n *             the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a\n *             bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to\n *             handle 307 redirect.

There are two ways to\n *          grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers.</p>\n *          <ul>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>Specify a canned ACL using the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header.
