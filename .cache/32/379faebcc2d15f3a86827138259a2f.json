You create a copy of your\n *             object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic operation using this API. However, to copy\n *             an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy API.\n *             For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html\">Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API</a>.</p>\n *          </note>\n *          <p>All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have\n *             <i>read</i> access to the source object and <i>write</i>\n *          access to the destination bucket. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html\">REST Authentication</a>. Both the Region\n *          that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to\n *          must be enabled for your account.</p>\n *          <p>A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3\n *          is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy operation starts, you receive a\n *          standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is\n *          embedded in the <code>200 OK</code> response. This means that a <code>200 OK</code>\n *          response can contain either a success or an error.

To\n *          override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request.

With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it.

If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was\n *          deleted. To copy a different version, use the <code>versionId</code> subresource.</p>\n *          <p>If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for\n *          the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source\n *          object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the\n *             <code>x-amz-version-id</code> response header in the response.</p>\n *          <p>If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that\n *          Amazon S3 generates is always null.</p>\n *          <p>If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object\n *          before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation.
