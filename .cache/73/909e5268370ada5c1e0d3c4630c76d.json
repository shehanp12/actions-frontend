Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for\n *             storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload. </p>\n *          </note>\n *\n *          <p>You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3\n *          encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you\n *          access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use AWS Key Management Service (AWS\n *          KMS) customer master keys (CMKs) or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys.

Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort\n *          operation and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload.

You initiate\n *          a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the\n *          multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special\n *          about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html\">Authenticating\n *             Requests (AWS Signature Version 4)</a>.</p>\n *\n *          <note>\n *             <p> After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being\n *             charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart\n *             upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for\n *             storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload. </p>\n *          </note>\n *\n *          <p>You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3\n *          encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you\n *          access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use AWS Key Management Service (AWS\n *          KMS) customer master keys (CMKs) or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide\n *          your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in <a href=\"AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html\">UploadPart</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html\">UploadPartCopy</a> requests must match the headers you used in the request to\n *          initiate the upload by using <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code>. </p>\n *          <p>To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS KMS CMK, the requester must\n *          have permission to the <code>kms:Encrypt</code>, <code>kms:Decrypt</code>,\n *             <code>kms:ReEncrypt*</code>, <code>kms:GenerateDataKey*</code>, and\n *             <code>kms:DescribeKey</code> actions on the key. These permissions are required because\n *          Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the\n *          multipart upload.</p>\n *\n *          <p>If your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same AWS account\n *          as the AWS KMS CMK, then you must have these permissions on the key policy.
