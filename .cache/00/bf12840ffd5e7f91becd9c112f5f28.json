You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object\n *          to it.</p>\n *\n *\n *          <p>Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the\n *          entire object to the bucket.</p>\n *\n *          <p>Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object\n *          simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object\n *          locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use\n *          versioning instead.</p>\n *\n *          <p>To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the\n *             <code>Content-MD5</code> header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object\n *          against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally,\n *          you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to\n *          the calculated MD5 value.</p>\n *          <note>\n *             <p> The <code>Content-MD5</code> header is required for any request to upload an object\n *             with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object Lock.

With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data\n *          when you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use AWS\n *          managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html\">Using Server-Side\n *             Encryption</a>.</p>\n *          <p>If you request server-side encryption using AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS), you can enable an S3 Bucket Key at the object-level. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html\">Amazon S3 Bucket Keys</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>\n *          <p>\n *             <b>Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request\n *          Headers</b>\n *          </p>\n *          <p>You can use headers to grant ACL- based permissions. By default, all objects are\n *          private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant\n *          permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These\n *          permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html\">Access Control List\n *             (ACL) Overview</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html\">Managing ACLs Using the REST\n *             API</a>. </p>\n *\n *          <p>\n *             <b>Storage Class Options</b>\n *          </p>\n *          <p>By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The\n *          STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on\n *          performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses\n *          the OUTPOSTS Storage Class.

Amazon S3 returns this ID in the response. When you enable\n *          versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object\n *          simultaneously, it stores all of the objects.</p>\n *          <p>For more information about versioning, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/AddingObjectstoVersioningEnabledBuckets.html\">Adding Objects to\n *             Versioning Enabled Buckets</a>.
